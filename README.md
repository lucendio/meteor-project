boilerplate for a meteor project
================================

... simple as that. This structure is considered as a starting point for smaller as well as bigger
meteor projects. Basically you will get a folder- and file structure as well as some pre-installed
packages



#### installed packages:

see [/app/.meteor/packages](app/.meteor/packages) and search for them on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/)


#### recommended packages:

+   appcache
+   http
+   frozeman:global-notifications
+   frozeman:template-var
+   msavin:mongol





### PLEASE NOTE:

+   ``/app/.meteor/.id`` does not exist, so it has to be created (meteor does that automatically)
+   the packages: ``insecure`` and ``autopublish`` are __NOT__ installed


### Contribution

Please be aware that this given structure is foremost for the authors point of view sufficiently.
But for any kind of advise or recommendation in terms of reasonable changes, please go ahead and
create an issue or pull request.
