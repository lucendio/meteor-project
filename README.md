boilerplate for a meteor project
================================

... simple as that. This structure is considered as a starting point for smaller as well as bigger
meteor projects. Basically you will get a folder- and file structure as well as some pre-installed
packages



#### installed packages:

see [/app/.meteor/packages](app/.meteor/packages) and search for them on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/)


#### interesting packages:

+   appcache
+   http
+   [frozeman:global-notifications](https://atmospherejs.com/frozeman/global-notifications)
+   [frozeman:template-var](https://atmospherejs.com/frozeman/template-var)
+   [alanning:roles](https://atmospherejs.com/alanning/roles)

+   [msavin:mongol](https://atmospherejs.com/msavin/mongol)
+   [lucendio:dlog](https://atmospherejs.com/lucendio/dlog)


#### included technologies:

+   markup: pure HTML templates
+   styling: stylus
+   programming language: JavaScript


### PLEASE NOTE:

+   ``/app/.meteor/.id`` does not exist, so it has to be created (meteor does that automatically)
+   the packages: ``insecure`` and ``autopublish`` are __NOT__ installed
